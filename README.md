# Network and Optimizers 

This repository contains implementations and experiments related to neural networks and various optimization techniques. The aim is to study the performance of different optimizers and their effect on neural network training.

## Project Structure

- **Optimizers_and_their_Convergence**: This contains mathematical details of implementation and working of different algorithms <br>
    as well as analysis of results of experiments. 
- **Experiments Code**: This folder contains the implementation of neural networks.
- **Images**: This folder contains result images and other visualizations.

## Results

Here is a sample result of the network training using different optimizers:
